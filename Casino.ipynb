    "An icon of the casino, the chip is an essential part of gaming and has been since its introduction in the late 19th century. Originally, casino currency took the form of golden coins and even gold nuggets, but as gaming grew in popularity, it became necessary to devise a uniform chip. Early chips were made of ivory or clay. As casinos closed or changed names, collectors grew fond of chips as a way to commemorate bygone eras. Now, each casino comes with its own chip design as a way to distinguish itself, and collectible chips also pop up from time to time.\n",
    "What differentiates casino chips is their branding, and our regular chips bear flourishes that represent the casino and other touches that make them appealing. Players enjoy playing with their tokens when they contemplate their bets—some experts say the psychological effect gives a sense of calmness and relaxation. Players exchange their chips at the cashier at any time they wish for paper currency.\n",
    "Outside of the casino, chips are enjoyed for their aesthetic value, with collectors seeking out special-edition or commemorative chips. This is a popular hobby with many international and domestic groups dedicated to the love of chips. Some collectors value their historic chips in the six figures range, and they are available on various online trading platforms and at auctions or conventions.\n",
